                Boro Okavango River safari is a mobile safari operator based in Maun, the tourism capital of Botswana
                and the gateway to the Okavango delta. Boro Okavango River Safari specializes in mobile safaris in all
                Botswanaâ€™s prime destinations. Our clients can tailor make their own safari either by road, boat cruise,
                Mokoro (dugout canoe) or a flight over the delta which will immerse the traveler in the untainted and
                untamed wilderness. As part of community tourism, the traveler will also enjoy an in-depth interaction
                with the local communities.
